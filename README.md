# wset
A command line tool that helps start up a new project and improve your productivity.

All you need is your new project directory name to the command
    `ws <project_directory_name>`

What happens after,
- it creates the project and opens it up with VSCode if you are using it

## Dependencies
 -  (click)[https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/]

 - pipenv


## How to use the tool:

    - run `pipenv install`
    - On the terminal run `pip install --editable .`
